# Broken Material UI Switch

Reproduction for Material UI's Switch component that is broken in MUI's version `5.0.0-alpha.25`.

To see the bug, run `npm i` and `npm start`. The project will launch in your browswer. Both the broken
and also a fixed version of the component are displayed.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
